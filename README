INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script requires two external packages to be installed before being run:
1. feedparser (http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/) - Documentation is given at
the site on what to do, but if setuptools is present you simply need to download
the source and run the setup script
2. Twitter (http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/) - Again with setuptools just type:
$ easy_install twitter
This package actually installs a couple of other tools to your path including a
command line twitter client. Launching this client the first time by typing:
$ twitter -h
will begin a setup process that creates a twitter api token needed by this 
script.

The script also requires a couple of global variables to be set before use:

TWITTER_OAUTH_KEY_FILE --> Path to twitter API token mentioned above
REQUESTED_GAMES_FILENAME --> This should be the path to a text file with a
newline delimited list of game titles that you wish the script to look for
